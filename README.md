## My process

### What I learned

For this challenge, I decided to try out Tailwind CSS for the first time. I have learned how to apply appropiate utility classes from Tailwind.
I learned also how to define my own tailwind subclasses to make my code more reusable.

Additionally, I exercised a little bit with dividing the project into React components.

### Possible upgrades

 - On hover snapshots of content of headers' elements.
 - Comments section.
